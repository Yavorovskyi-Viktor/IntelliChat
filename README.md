### Overview
IntelliChat is a Python-based chatbot designed to engage in conversations with users, perform arithmetic operations, and provide information sourced from Wikipedia. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a neural network model for intent classification.

### Features
1. **Conversation Handling**: IntelliChat engages in conversations with users, responding to various inputs and inquiries.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: It can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **Wikipedia Integration**: IntelliChat can search Wikipedia for information based on user queries.
4. **Typewriter Effect**: Responses from IntelliChat are printed with a typewriter effect for a visually appealing display.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Utilized for training and loading the neural network model for intent classification.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text processing and lemmatization.
- **Wikipedia API**: Integrated to retrieve information from Wikipedia.
- **Colorama**: Employed for colored text output.

### Components
1. **Intent Classification Model**: A trained neural network model used to classify user intents based on their input.
2. **Preprocessing Functions**: Functions for cleaning and preprocessing user input before classification.
3. **Wikipedia Search Function**: Utilizes the Wikipedia API to retrieve information based on user queries.
4. **Typewriter Print Function**: Delivers responses with a typewriter effect for visual appeal.
5. **Main Interaction Loop**: Manages the flow of conversation, processing user input and providing appropriate responses.

### Usage
1. **Input**: Users can interact with IntelliChat by typing messages or inquiries.
2. **Output**: IntelliChat responds with appropriate answers or engages in conversation based on the input received.
3. **Exit**: Users can exit the conversation by typing 'quit', 'exit', or 'close'.

### Dependencies
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **wikipedia**: Required for accessing Wikipedia data.
- **colorama**: Necessary for colored text output.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For loading the neural network model.
- **NLTK**: Used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
